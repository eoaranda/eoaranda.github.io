      <description>HI, My name is Edgar, I live in ðŸ—½ and I am a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in several technologies, languages, frameworks, and databases. In this past years I have worked with plenty environments, developing tools, methodologies and version control tools for small and multinational teams.
I have profitiently worked in different business areas like retail, e-commerce, security, education, energy and health industries.
My main work collaboration has been in propriertary projects and companies, so its complicated to share a full spectrum of my work experience, but you can find some of my side projects in my projects section.</description>
