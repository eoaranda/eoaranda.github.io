            <description>Project: This is my first electron App, maybe a little too late regarding on what is the future for electron but I needed a very minimal vertical stocks ticker app.
Important note, the app comes AS-IS , also this was a weekend hack so expect some not tested edge cases.
Modes If the martket is open it will display a small sun and if closed a small moon. This is not just a visual aid, but at day it will create a direct websocket connection to update data and at night it will pull data manually every 30min.</description>
